## Let's Learn About Salt!
### Why Salt?
APIs are the most efficient way to run any business. They are the DNA of the Modern Enterprise. This is because they allow you to codify how your organization operates, doing so in a massively scalable, repeatable, reliable, automated, and iterable fashion. But now that this is how business is done, you must take measures to secure your business and that's where Salt comes in. We can inventory, block, and help you fix your APIs. All you need to do is mirror your API traffic and we'll handle the rest.
