# Welcome to Demoland!

## Let's Talk OX!
### Why Anything?
Software is the most efficient way to run any business. Its source code is the DNA of every modern corporation. This is because it allows us to codify how our organizations operate, doing so in a massively scalable, repeatable, reliable, automated, and iterable fashion. But given that this is how business is done, we must take measures to insure that our software is securely made so that we, our customers and our business partners can trust it and by extension, each other. Because any sufficiently powerful technology can be used for good...or evil. Put another way, with great power, comes great responsibility.

### Why Now?
Attackers of software are advancing nearly as quickly as builders. While we'll never stop 100% of them, we can harden and monitor our pipelines so as to make us not worth an attacker's time relative to other targets. Yet if they do attempt an attack, we must be ready.

### Why OX?
OX can inventory and help you fix your source code, your platform, and your entire software pipeline, from code to cloud, continuously and automatically. All you need to do is hook up your source code repositories and you're off to the races! OX will prompty scan and reveal where you are most vulnerable while "de-noising" your issues thanks to our correlation, de-duplication, and rigorous re-prioritization logic. And all of it can be applied to your CI/CD processes and further automated with no-code workflows that instantly share the findings across your ticketing systems, chat ops, email, etc.
